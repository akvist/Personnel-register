## Introduction

This is a backend project, a REST API created with Node.js and express.

The API is a personnel register where you can get all personnel in the register, add an employee or remove an employee from the register. The project contains tests made with jest and supertest.

## Scope of functionalities

This project is a personnel register. The register is saved in memory and changes are thus not saved in between runnings. When starting the server, the register consists of three employees. The projects contains suitable tests.

You can:

- GET: Get all personnel from the register.
- POST: Add an employee to the register by entering the name, last name and email of the employee.
  - If name, last name or/and email is missing, the employee will not be added to the register.
  - An employee with an unique name, last name and email will be added to the register.
  - If there already is an employee with the same name or/and last name but a different email, they will be added to the register.
  - If there already is an employee with the given email, the employee will not be added to the register.
- DELETE: Remove an employee from the register by entering the name, last name and email of the employee.
  - For the employee to be deleted, the name, last name and email have to concur for the employee with the entered email.
    - If name, last name or/and email is missing, the employee will not be removed from the register.

Informative messages and statuscodes are sent for each response.

When checking if an employee exists in the register, it searches for the entered email since email addresses should be unique and several employees can have the same name and/or last name. For safety reasons, the personnel only gets deleted if the name and last name matches with the email. In other words, entered name, last name and email needs to match with an existing employee for the employee to be deleted. This is so that the wrong employee would not be accidentally removed.

## Highlights

**Highlights of this project**:

- Creating RESTful API:s with express
- Managing git and GitHub
- Managing the asynchronous aspect in JavaScript
- Cathching errors and
- Sending status codes and messages for responses
- Includes suitable tests
- Using environmental variables
- Managing the local scope, global scope and block scope of JavaScript
- Using body-parser
- Writing understandable code by naming of functions/variables and by structure of code
- The logic that only allows an employee with an unique email adress to be added, even if the name is the same as someone in the register
- The logic that only allows an employee with an existing email and the same name and last name as the entered info to be deleted
- Splitting the project into modules
- Writing commit messages
